# Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:
# 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
print(3 * 'un' + 'ium')

# Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:
word = 'Python'
print(word[0])  # character in position 0
print(word[5])  # character in position 5
